## Get Started

**Heads up!** All scripts should be run from the root of the project, if no other directory is mentioned

First of all, make sure your local environment have the following installed:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - v10.15.3 _\*Tip! If you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md), you can run `nvm use` to set the correct node.js version._<br>
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) - v1.15.2<br>

All set? Let's proceed! :ok_hand: :smile:

### 1. **Create a `.env.local`-file**

Copy the content of `.env.local.example`-file located at the root directory.

### 2. **Install dependencies**

In your terminal run `yarn` from the project root directory.

### 3. **Run the project in development mode**

In your terminal run `yarn start` from the project root directory.
