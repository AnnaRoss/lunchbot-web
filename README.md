First of all, make sure your local environment have the following installed:

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - v10.15.3 _\*Tip! If you use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.md), you can run `nvm use` to set the correct node.js version._<br>
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) - v1.15.2<br>

All set? Let's proceed! :ok_hand: :smile:
